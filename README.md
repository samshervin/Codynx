# CodynX
CodynX helps you collaborate with your coding buddies and code together in real-time. 
Note that this is not a Version Control System like Git. 
Your code and your partner's code will be shared in a side-by-side format so you can chat with your partner via call or text(feature will be added in future) and code together.
You can copy your partner's code and paste it in your IDE to execute the code.
